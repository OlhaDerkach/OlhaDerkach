- 👋 Hi, I’m Olha.
- 👀 As an IT lawyer in the past, now I am striving to grow as a QA specialist.
- 🌱 At the moment I am practicing to create quality test documentation. Also I study HTML, CSS, XML, JSON, SQL. In the near future, I plan to pay attention to test automation.
- 💞️ As an aspiring QA engineer, I am happy to work for free with those who need to test their projects.
